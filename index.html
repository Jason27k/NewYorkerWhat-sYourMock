                <p class="text"> <span class="drop-cap">W</span>hether you’re horrifying your teen with nauseating sex-ed analogies or watching TikToks while your toddler eats a bagel from the subway floor, face it: you’re flailing in the vast chasm of your child’s relentless needs. Why not get comfortable with your ineptitude? Discover your unique parenting-failure style with this fun quiz:</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="number">1.</span> Your eight-year-old has been watching chainsaw demonstrations on YouTube lately. You wake up one morning to a loud buzzing from the back yard, followed by a crash. Do you:</p>
                <p class="text">(a) Put an extra frozen waffle in the toaster—sounds like she’s working up an appetite.</p>
                <p class="text">(b) Performatively yell at her so that the neighbors can hear, but then, in private, praise her—those landscaping skills will pay for college.</p>
                <p class="text">(c) Chuckle into your cannabis-infused morning smoothie and turn up the volume on “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.”</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="number">2.</span> You’re about to board a six-hour flight home from a family vacation, and your five-year-old, who just ate twelve very ripe plums, says his tummy hurts. Do you:</p>
                <p class="text">(a) Tape the lower half of his body into a duty-free bag and hope for the best.</p>
                <p class="text">(b) Take a business-class upgrade—the last one available—and wish your spouse good luck.</p>
                <p class="text">(c) Say, “What’s your name, young man? You’re a little young to be travelling alone!,” so that everyone can hear.</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="number">3.</span> Your mother-in-law took your fourteen-year-old to see a foreign film. Over lunch at Olive Garden afterward, he wonders aloud about a specific sexual practice that a character in the movie refers to. Do you:</p>
                <p class="text">(a) Tell him to ask the server about it.</p>
                <p class="text">(b) Describe it, using breadsticks and onion rings as visual aids.</p>
                <p class="text">(c) Put on a Chappell Roan playlist and hope he figures it out.</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="number">4.</span> Your sixth grader is doing makeup tutorials on Instagram that include shoplifting tips and savage descriptions of her science teacher’s appearance. Do you:</p>
                <p class="text">(a) Tell her to try harder next time—she didn’t even mention Mr. Welch’s hideous breath.</p>
                <p class="text">(b) Monetize her platform—you’ll need cash for bail one day.</p>
                <p class="text">(c) Explain that her glow definitely doesn’t come from within, and her frosted blush isn’t doing her any favors.</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="number">5.</span> Your adult child is pregnant with her guru’s baby and asks to borrow ten thousand dollars so the two of them can start a colonic-hydrotherapy center together. Do you:</p>
                <p class="text">(a) Refuse—she’s been rejecting your guru’s advances for years, so this just feels rude.</p>
                <p class="text">(b) Explain that your long-distance fiancé, Stanislav, has all your money tied up in a bitcoin mine.</p>
                <p class="text">(c) Tell her you’ll send twenty thousand if she gives you the placenta to use in a facial.</p>
